## Q26_QuanTrader

Q26 QuanTrader is a financial investment system dedicated to algorithmic trading developers who only whant to focus on the development of their trading strategies and not on all the structural framework around. I recommend to the users to use this project with the [Q26 QuanTester][1] dedicated to trading strategies development. This tool is developed thanks to Python 3. 

### Main features 

- Python based : very simple confiduration file & strategies design model.
- Trading strategies developed with [Q26 QuanTester][1] are immediately compatible with this tool. 
- Multi-brokerage choice : With connexion to IBKR (TWS) and MT4 trading platforms, the user has choice to a very large panel of compatible brokers. 
- Precise trading actions record : Every action of the trading algorithm is stored in a log and can be used for futher studies. 

A lot more interesting features are coming !
